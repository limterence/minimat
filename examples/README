Sample program source files written in MiniMat language. Note that the
support library routines have been collected into different file names in
this directory, so as to help illustrate the examples presented in the final
report.

Run "make" to compile programs (requires minimat compiler, and run-time
MiniMat library source files).

But run "make noplot" instead to compile programs without gnuplot 
functionality.
